Here is the code used to create our maze environment for our AI801 class project.

Update(4/3/2023): Hi guys so the final_maze.py is is now changed to MazeEnv.py so you can just import MazeEnv easily and DFS_Maze is the standalone DFS example with MazeEnv instation, DFS algorithm, DFS call and animation.
