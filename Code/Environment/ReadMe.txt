Here is the code used to create our maze environment for our AI801 class project.

Update(4/3/2023): Hi guys so the final_maze.py is is now changed to MazeEnv.py so you can just import MazeEnv easily and DFS_Maze is the standalone DFS example with MazeEnv instation, DFS algorithm, DFS call and animation.

Update(4/25/2023): Hi guys so I finally uploaded the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. So the MazeEnvRL is the the environment specially tailor for the RL algorithm. The RL_Maze the where the RL method is, you can kinda follow the instructions there... kinda. Just make sure you have Pytorch installed, it should be easy enough if you have Pycharm. And try to run the segments that are kinda marked with the """ - SEGMENT - """ format.
